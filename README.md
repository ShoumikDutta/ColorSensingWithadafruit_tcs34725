# Color Sensor Detection Script

This Python script uses the TCS34725 color sensor to identify if the detected color is closer to red or blue and returns a boolean value accordingly.

## Requirements

- **Hardware**:
  - TCS34725 color sensor
  - Raspberry Pi or compatible device

- **Software**:
  - Python 3
  - `adafruit-circuitpython-tcs34725` library

## Installation

1. **Connect the TCS34725 sensor to your device**:
   - Connect the SDA and SCL pins of the sensor to the corresponding pins on your device.

2. **Install the required library**:
   ```sh
   pip install adafruit-circuitpython-tcs34725
   ```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository or copy the script**:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Run the script**:
   ```sh
   python detect_color.py
   ```

3. **Script Output**:
   - The script will print the RGB values detected by the sensor.
   - It will also print whether the detected color is red or blue based on the comparison of red and blue values.

## Script Explanation

The script initializes the TCS34725 sensor, reads the RGB values, and determines if the color is closer to red or blue. Based on this, it returns `True` for red and `False` for blue.



### Parameters

- **Integration Time**:
  - Adjust the `integration_time` for the sensor to control how long the sensor integrates readings. This affects the sensitivity and accuracy of the readings.
  
- **Gain**:
  - Adjust the `gain` to control the sensor's sensitivity to light. Higher gain increases sensitivity.

### Notes

- Calibration may be required for accurate results in different environments.
- This script uses a simple thresholding method. For more complex scenarios, consider using additional metrics or machine learning models to improve accuracy.
